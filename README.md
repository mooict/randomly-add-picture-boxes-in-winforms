# Randomly Add Picture Boxes in Windows Form and Collide with player object


Hi, in this tutorial we will explore how to  create a windows form game where you can move the player left, right, up and down, spawn other items picture boxes in random positions inside of the form, move the player collide with the other picture boxes and finally remove the item picture boxes from the windows form application. We want to do all of this from the C# programming script. As a added bonus lets also code in how to change the back colour of dynamically created picture boxes in the app.


    Create a randomly spawning picture box app in windows form application
    Work Picture Boxes, Timer and Label in the form
    Code in Key Down, Key Up and Timer event#
    Create custom function to add the picture boxes
    Work with Arrays and Lists
    Add and move items from lists and from the main windows application
    Create a spawn time counter that controls how often the objects are spawned in the form
